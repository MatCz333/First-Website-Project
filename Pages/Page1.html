			<p><span class="firstLetter">Y</span> ou've got to wake up. Now! They'll be here any minute to stop you … I mean me … actually they're after
			me but I'm you so it affects you too. Get out of bed. There's no time to put on clothes. We need to find a
			place to hide for a little while. Come. Through the window. Urgh … third story is quite high up, isn't it?
			But you don't need to be afraid. I'll be with you.
			</p>
			<p>No, we can't visit anyone you—I—we know because they will find out.</p>
			<p>Why they're after us? We … you will develop something so cool they want to keep playing with it.</p>
			<p>Why I'm trying to stop you? Well, let's find a safe place first and I'll tell you. Come on, it's only a few
			more steps down the fire escape, and there's a manhole cover in the alley below. They won't suspect us
			there.</p>
			<p>Yes, it stinks. Can't be helped. Stay on the footpath. There should be a workman's room ahead. Gosh,
			I'll have to oil the hinges. There. Sit on the sofa. The clothes are for you, but I'm not sure they'll fit. I've
			never been good at remembering the sizes I wore, and you're the youngest <i>me</i> I've met. So to speak you're
			the root of all my mess.</p>
			<p>Yes, I am old. I'm probably the oldest me you'll ever meet. After my return I'll die in all realities. I'vechecked.</p>
			<p>What? Yes, I can time travel. And so can they. That's why you cannot tell anyone about this hideyhole, or they'll find us. But I already know you will not, because they're not here yet.</p>
			<p>You're right, I should sit down too.</p>
			<p>They are members of the Time Police, and they've been tasked with stopping me from stopping <i>me</i>.</p>
			<p>How I know? Well, they killed me in several time lines already. It's disjointing to say the least,because as long as I exist, I will carry all the memories of the others with me.</p>
			<p>Why I've come to you, and what I'm trying to stop you from doing? You will build a time machine, and that will change the world. It will literally split it up.</p>
			<p> Shall I?</p>
