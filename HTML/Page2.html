				<p><span class="firstLetter">F</span>ine. You've got a bright head on your shoulders, young man. Getting into university at your age isn't an easy feat, but you already know that. If you keep up working the way you do now, you will discover a trick of the time that everyone overlooked so far, including Einstein, and he was brilliant. You will keep your discovery to yourself while you explore the consequences. However, on September 3rd next year, you will build a time machine. And for what? Because you will be sorry that you declined your fellow student's invitation for a date. </p>
				<p>Which student? Haha, I will not tell you. It will have to remain a mystery to the day she asks</p>
				<p>You will build your machine in the backyard of your parents house. It will look a lot like a bicycle in a wire cage, which it mostly consists of, with a yard-long lance protruding from the front. Seven car batteries are fitted inside, and although charging them will take several hours, they will provide enough power for any length of trip. As soon as you will sit on the seat and use the pedals to release a thin but steady stream of energy, the machine will glow with an unearthly sheen and catapult you out of your time. You will travel the River of Time, and it will look like a real river to you. The waves will contain myriads of pictures of billions of people living though countless moments in time, and you will become addicted.</p>
				<p>When you leave the time stream, you will meet her without her noticing that you're there twice. During the film you two will visit, you will kiss her, and love will bloom, although she'll often wonder why you don't seem to recognize her at times. Then, you will catch up with your old time stream and your relationship will improve. Still, you'll spend long intervals in the time stream simply watching the ripples human lives make. Sometimes, she will complain but rarely</p>
				<p>On Sunday July 7th, three years from now, you will ask her for her hand in marriage, your heart brimming with the love you feel for her.</p>
				<p>What do you think she will say to you?</p>
				<div class="breaker"></div>
				<p> <a href="page4.html" class="pathChoosing1">Will she say yes?</a></p>
				<div class="breaker"></div>
				<p><a href="page7.html" class="pathChoosing2">Or she will say no?</a></p>
