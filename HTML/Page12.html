				<p><span class="firstLetter">Y</span>ou will ponder his offer. Would it really be so bad to gain a little more power, or to secure the funds for few more years of research?</p>
				<p>The bald man will fill your ears with his political agenda; enough work and equal pay for everyone, healthy food for all, regular schooling for all children regardless their upbringing, a safety net of health insurance and retirement pensions. It will all sound so good to you that you will agree to his bargain.</p>
				<p>What follows will be a nightmare. It will start small. You will organize money for him and denounce competition by planting false evidence in the past. You will do everything he asks of you because if you stop, your secret will not be a secret much longer. And what would become of the world if everyone would change their past? Little will you know how much your unwanted partner will dread the same.</p>
				<p>Your heart will ache all the time as you watch the bald man rise to power, always smiling, always jovial. The changes in society will be subtle at first, but soon you will notice the restrictions of personal freedom. When the end of the bald man's second term as President will draw near, he will change important laws. This time you will have a lot to do, bribing, hindering, even murdering senators. You will return to the third time of his presidency feeling sick to the stomach. Still, you will smile with him and reassure him that you're his best friend.</p>
				<p>That's why he will look so shocked the day you press a 3D-printed colt onto the bridge of his nose. But when you pull the trigger, the gun will explode. Both of you will obtain severe injuries, but while he will wake up in a luxurious hospital, you will be left untreated in a jail overflowing with the scum of the world. </p>
				<p>Your wounds will infect, and the jail's doctors will only do the bare minimum to keep you alive. To torture you even more, the President will allow you a television set with nothing but the official news channel. You will be forced to watch him conquer most of the world. Once, he will even wave your notes about the time machine around, pretending they're nothing but a speech. You will squirm knowing the power he has.</p>
				<p>Soon after, he will become Emperor of Earth. He will visit you then, telling you of a lone version of yourself destroying its other selves in the other timelines and how he plans to counter the man's attacks. He will assemble a small elite troupe of extremely loyal men and women to be his Time Police and provide them with several time machines. Thus equipped they will be able to wipe out any threat to him in his present, past, and future. Of course he brags how he will never tell them how the time machine works, but you know they are bound to use them for their own good too. And since you will be locked away, unable to assemble another time machine, you will not be able to do anything against it.</p>
				<p>When he will be gone, you will cry until I show up. </p>
				<p>I will tell you of all the mes I thwarted and even killed. You will smile as I tell you about all the burned notes, the smashed, burnt, or dismantled time machines. You will even try to sit up despite your pain when I explain how I have materialized in the bald man's bedroom, shot him, burnt his notes and destroyed his time machine, and his guards never so much as heard me. Together we will watch the news about his death. You will cry tears of joy when I tell you that there are only two more time lines to change. One will be the one I have come from. And the other will be the only one I hope to turn into a happy end for all of us. </p>
				<p><q>Will he … I … be happy there?</q> you will ask, and I will nod. Surely at least one of us will find true
				love, but if not, I will do what needs to be done for as long as my old, frail body will live.</p>
