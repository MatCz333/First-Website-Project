				<p><span class="firstLetter">I</span>n the passing years, you will have learned a lot about time and the time stream. You will realize that if
				you go back to your own timeline, you might cause a paradox as long as the split-off time lines still
				existed. What would the time do to prevent it? Would it destroy time lines if you follow that path? You
				will decide to leave this problem for last. For now, you will concentrate on finding your other selves.
				You will either kill them or put them on a better path in life. Like a beacon, the face of the girl you loved
				so much will light up your soul. Maybe you will be able to find only one of your previous selves that will
			be allowed true happiness.</p>
			<p>Your first meeting with the Time Police is short but painful. They will shoot at you. Luckily the layout
				of depot where you landed will be very confusing, and the bullet will miss you. It will dislodge a heavy
				crate which will shatter your leg. It's agony to free your flesh from the crate's shards, but you will work
				fast. Using a long wooden splinter as a crutch, you will evade the Time Police in the gigantic storage
				room. You will not believe your luck when you discover that you've landed in a depot full of pre-loaded
				car batteries. Despite your broken leg, you manage to sneak one of them to your machine. One member of
				the Time Police will be guarding it, but you will knock him out with the battery before he even notices
				you. It won't take you long to fetch some more batteries and replace the used ones in your machine. Just as
			the policeman returns to consciousness, you will escape into the time stream</p>
			<p>This encounter will show you that the time machine as it is at that point in time will be too
				cumbersome to use often. Also it takes too long to recharge the batteries. You will decide to find a place
				to rest where your leg will be able to heal while you will improve the machine in secret. You will set
				course for a thread of time unpolluted by the effects of your time machine and trundle upstream into the
				future while pondering how to miniaturize the machine and increase its battery life. You will hope that the
			doctors in the future have a way of renewing the splintered bone in your leg.</p>
			<p>Once those two problems will be solved, you will head for the first in a long line of time threads split
				off your own life to eliminate all knowledge of your invention. If only you would be able to shake off the
				Time Police. Although they cannot trace your movements, they will show up in some threads of your
				former selves' lives. It will be difficult to evade them, but you will succeed.
