		<h1>About the Author</h1><br>
		<img src="../Assets/Images/Katharina Gerlach.jpg" alt="Katharina Gerlach Image" id="author">
		<p>Katharina Gerlach was born in Germany in 1968. She and her three younger brothers grew up in the middle of a forest in the heart of the Luneburgian Heather. After romping through the forest with imagination as her guide, the tomboy learned to read and disappeared into magical adventures, past times or eerie fairytale woods.</p><br>
		<p>She didn’t stop at reading. During her training as a landscape gardener, she wrote her first novel, a manuscript full of a beginner’s mistakes. Fortunately, she found books on Creative Writing and soon her stories improved. For a while, reality interfered with her writing but after finishing a degree in forestry and a PhD in Science she returned to her vocation. She likes to write Fantasy, Science Fiction and Historical Novels for all age groups.</p><br>
		<p>At present, she is writing at her next project in a small house near Hildesheim, Germany, where she lives with her husband, three children and a dog.</p><br>
