			<p><span class="firstLetter">W</span>hen you return from your trip, you will roll the time machine into your living room and cover it with a blanket. Proudly you will admire the framed certificate on your wall proving you're dean now.</p>
			<p>At that moment, your doorbell will ring, startling you. Since your machine is hidden to the best of your knowledge, you will open the door reluctantly. Imagine your surprise when you recognize the man standing on your doorstep. It will be the same man whose application you torpedoed. It will have been just a short while ago for you, but years for him. He will greet you with a smile, and you will invite him in. Something in your mind will tell you that he means trouble. </p>
			<p>You will offer him a drink and ask what brought him to your town, and he will tell you his tale.</p>
			<p><q>I came to thank you for stopping me from going to that job interview when I applied as an assistant professor at your university,</q> he will say. <q>The rejection hit me so hard, I changed my profession completely. I decided to follow my father's footsteps in politics, and by now I've already been nominated as senator for the next election. I admit, I am the big outsider. Not many believe I stand a chance, but I know something they don't.</q> Sipping his whiskey, he'll smile at you, but his eyes will remain icy.</p>
			<p>Your fingers will clench around the neck of the heavy decanter, and your throat will dry out, making it hard to speak. <q>Care to explain?</q></p>
			<p><q>Well, my friend, when I stepped out of my taxi this afternoon, I walked around your house to confront you with what you've done to my career as a scientist. I couldn't find you, so I lay in the grass of your garden, watching your living room through your windows, expecting you to walk through the doors at some point. Imagine my surprise when you appeared in a glowing cage-like machine out of nowhere just explanation for your appearance is that you invented something that no one else has. It could be a machine for traveling long distances, but if I had to bet money on it, I would say it's a time machine.</q></p>
			<p>You will stand frozen at your bar, too numb to ask questions.</p>
			<p><q>I have a proposal for you,</q> he will continue. <q>You will help me with my political career, and I will pay you a secret salary no scientist ever had, a salary the IRS won't know about. If I become senator, I will privately fund a research project of your choice.</q> </p>
			<p><q>What would I need to do?</q> The words will leave your mouth before your brain has caught up with the events.</p>
			<p><q>For a successful campaign I will need more funds, so the first step would be a trip two weeks back to my previous self to hand him a printout of some of the stocks I was considering to buy at that time.</q> He will look so smug, you really long to smash his face. But his offer will entice you too—unlimited money, research funding for the foreseeable future … You will hesitate.</p>
